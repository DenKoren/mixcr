## Overview

MiXCR is a universal software for fast and accurate analysis of raw T- or B- cell receptor repertoire sequencing data.

 - Easy to use. Default pipeline can be executed without any additional parameters (see *Usage* section)

 - TCR and IG repertoires
 
 - Following species are supported *out-of-the-box* using built-in library:
   - human
   - mouse
   - rat (only TRB and TRA)
   - *... several new species will be available soon*

- Efficiently extract repertoires from most of (if not *all*) types of TCR/IG-containing raw sequencing data:
  - data from all specialized RepSeq sample preparation protocols
  - RNA-Seq
  - WGS
  - single-cell data
  - *etc..*

- Has optional CDR3 reconstruction step, that allows to *recover full hypervariable region from several disjoint reads*. Uses sophisticated algorithms protecting from false-positive assemblies at the same time having best in class efficiency.

- Assemble clonotypes, applying several *error-correction* algorithms to eliminate artificial diversity arising from PCR and sequencing errors

- Clonotypes can be assembled based on CDR3 sequence (default) as well as any other region, including *full-length* variable sequence (from beginning of FR1 to the end of FR4)

- Assemble full TCR/Ig receptor sequences 

- Provides exhaustive output information for clonotypes and per-read alignments:
  - nucleotide and amino acid sequences of all immunologically relevant regions (FR1, CDR1, ..., CDR3, etc..)
  - identified V, D, J, C genes
  - nucleotide and amino acid mutations in germline regions
  - variable region topology (number of end V / D / J nucleotide deletions, length of P-segments, number of non-template N nucleotides)
  - sequencing quality scores for any extracted sequence
  - several other useful pieces of information
  
- Completely transparent pipeline, possible to track individual read fate from raw fastq entry to clonotype. Several useful tools available to evaluate pipeline performance: human readable alignments visualization, diff tool for alignment and clonotype files, etc...


## Installation / Download

#### Using Homebrew on Mac OS X or Linux (linuxbrew)

    brew install milaboratory/all/mixcr
    
to upgrade already installed MiXCR to the newest version:

    brew update
    brew upgrade mixcr

#### Docker

See [official Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/milaboratory/mixcr).

#### Manual install (any OS)

* download latest stable MiXCR build from [release page](https://github.com/milaboratory/mixcr/releases/latest)
* unzip the archive
* add resulting folder to your ``PATH`` variable
  * or add symbolic link for ``mixcr`` script to your ``bin`` folder
  * or use MiXCR directly by specifying full path to the executable script

#### Requirements

* Any OS with Java support (Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, etc..)
* Java 1.8 or higher
 
## Usage

See usage examples in the official documentation https://mixcr.readthedocs.io/en/master/quickstart.html

## Build

Requirements:

- Maven 3 (https://maven.apache.org/)

To build MiXCR from source:

- Clone repository

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/milaboratory/mixcr.git
  ```

- Refresh git submodules

  ```
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```
  
- Run build script. First build may take several minuties to download sequences for built-in V/D/J/C gene libraries from NCBI.

  ```
  ./build.sh
  ```
